## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher) or Yarn
- Git

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/bankloan-management-frontend.git
cd bankloan-management-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Replace `http://localhost:5000/api` with the actual backend API URL.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with a backend API (not included in this repo). Ensure the backend server is running and the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable is correctly set. 

### Example endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/login`: User authentication
- `GET /api/loans`: Fetch loan applications
- `POST /api/loans`: Submit a new loan application

## Deployment

To deploy the app:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the contents of the `dist/` folder** to a static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
